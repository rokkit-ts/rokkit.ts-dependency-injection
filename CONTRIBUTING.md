#### Before I submit a Bug

Please check the list in order to submit a new bug:

- Check if the problem belongs to Rokkit.ts, try to debug you application and see if you can find a fix by yourself.
- Can you reproduce the bug? Please note down any steps needed to create the bug.
- Determine which repository the problem should be reported in.
- Please search for similar issues that are allready reported. If you find any corrolated bugs please add a comment instead of creating a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in the [issue template](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
- **Describe the behavior** you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected** to see instead and why.
- **State the used versions** for Rokkit.ts, TypeScript and Node.js.
- **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

### Suggesting Enhancements

We will guide you through the process on how to suggest enhancements to the project. These guidelines helps us to evaluate and discuss your ideas faster and may include it in future version of the framework.

#### Before I submit a suggestion for an enhancement

- Check that your enhancement is not support by any module of the framework.
- Determine to which repository your enhancement belongs
- Search for similar enhancements that are already described in a repository

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) suggestion for an enhancement?

Enhancements are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined which repository your enhancement is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information in the [feature request template](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md).

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- **Provide a step-by-step description** of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples** to demonstrate the steps. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code blocks.
- **Describe the current behavior** and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- **List some other frameworks or libraries** where this enhancement exists.

### Your First Code Contribution

You are unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through beginner friendly issues:

Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.

There will be issues that are labeled as beginner friendly within the different repositories, just have a look and try to tackle one of these!
